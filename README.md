# ConnectMe
## _CreateCollab Hackathon (https://discord.gg/cAhtP4qzWG)_ 
This project was ideated, designed, and engineered within a 7 hour hackathon based in Flutter and Firebase.   

ConnectMe is an app that helps you find other people to assist you with all sorts of requests.  It could be something simple like needing somebody to play sports with you near your house or walk you home through a particular part of the neighborhood.

After the app loads, it will automatically move to the sign-up page.  You can anonymously register to use the app using a Firebase backend.  There is a registration form, but it is not functional.

You need to provide some information about yourself. What you need help with and what your request is going to be on the next page. This will help you get help faster and with more quality the more necessary details you provide. 

When posting your request out there, mention what you feel like you need help with, choosing out of related category. Except for the location everything else is non-mandatory, but better for you if you are descriptive.
